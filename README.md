# APB Verification Project

This repository contains my graduate-level project on the verification of an **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Master and Slave interface** using **SystemVerilog** and **QuestaSim**.

The goal was to verify proper communication between the APB Master and Slave modules under various test scenarios, including read/write operations and error conditions.
